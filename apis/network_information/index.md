## Summary

Provides an interface for web applications to access the underlying connection information of the device.

[NetworkInformation](/apis/network_information/NetworkInformation)
:   Is exposed on the Navigator object, and all instances of the Navigator type are defined to also implement the NetworkInformation interface.

## Usage

     The main use case of the Network Information API is to allow applications to be gentle with the user's bandwidth when they know it is rare or expensive.

## Notes

As of 25 June 2014:

-   Formal work on the [Network Information](http://www.w3.org/TR/netinfo-api/) spec has been stopped. The specification is now a W3C Note.
-   Both Chrome and Firefox have shipped Network Information under an experimental feedback channel.
