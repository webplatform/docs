## Summary

Provides information about the battery status of the hosting device.

API Name
:   Summary

[NavigatorBattery](/apis/battery_status/NavigatorBattery)
:   The NavigatorBattery interface is exposed on the Navigator object.

## Usage

     The Battery Status API can be used to defer or scale back work when the device is not charging in or is low on battery. An archetype of an advanced web application, a web-based email client, may check the server for new email every few seconds if the device is charging, but do so less frequently if the device is not charging or is low on battery. Another example is a web-based word processor which could monitor the battery level and save changes before the battery runs out to prevent data loss.
