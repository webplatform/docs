For WindowsÂ XP, this method sends an event to an event tracing session with TraceEvent; for systems after WindowsÂ XP, this method writes an event with EventWrite. The event includes a pointer to a **window** object, current markup, and the event name passed as *bstrProfilerMarkName*. The *bstrProfilerMarkName* property has a 32-character limit when called from script. This method is useful to profile real website performance by using the operating system metrics as a baseline.
