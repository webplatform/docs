I have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Web Platform
Contributor Agreement.

This Contributor Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between You,
the participating individual or entity contributing content to the Web
Platform Documentation Site (“Contributor”), and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, having an office at 77 Massachusetts Avenue,
Room E19-750, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139-4307, USA (“MIT”); the
European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics, having an
office at 2004, Route des Lucioles, Sophia Antipolis, F-06410 Biot,
France (“ERCIM”); Keio University, having an office at 5322 Endo,
Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0882, Japan (“KEIO”) (collectively, “W3C Hosts”)
on behalf of the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”). This Agreement is
effective as of the date Contributions are submitted by Contributor
(“the Effective Date”).

Contributor wishes to make available certain original works of
authorship created or controlled by Contributor including but not
limited to documentation, reports, papers, instruction manuals, and
other writings, code, software tools, and databases (“Contribution”) for
inclusion in the Web Platform Documentation Site ("Site").

W3C, in conjunction with the other Site Stewards, wishes to host some or
all of that material on the Site under public licenses that enable
others, without payment of fees or royalties, to copy, modify,
redistribute, and re-license such material on similar terms,

Therefore, Contributor agrees to license and hereby licenses copyright
in its Contributions to W3C Hosts MIT, ERCIM, and KEIO under an
unrestricted, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide,
royalty-free, sublicensable, transferrable license authorizing all uses,
including reproduction, distribution, creation of derivative works,
public display, public performance, and public digital performance of
sound recordings.

Contributor asserts that it has all rights necessary to so license its
Contributions, and that the reproduction and publication on the Site
will not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party.

IN NO EVENT SHALL CONTRIBUTOR, MIT, ERCIM, OR KEIO, THEIR TRUSTEES,
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND ASSOCIATES BE LIABLE FOR
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ECONOMIC
DAMAGE OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL
HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY.
