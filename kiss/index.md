## KISS

Acronym for "Keep It Simple, Stupid", "Keep It Short and Simple", etc. Based on the principle that reducing complexity in a system (typically a factor of the number of system elements) reduces the potential for errors, and thus that the avoidance of unnecessary complexity should be a key goal in any design effort.
