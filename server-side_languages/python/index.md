## Summary

[Python](http://python.org/) is a dynamic programming language which emphasizes code readability. It is widely used in a variety of areas, most notably scientific computing and system administration, though it has recently gained much wider usage in web development.

### Similarity with Javascript

-   Functional programming features
-   Dynamic typing

### Features

-   "Batteries-included" - numerous useful standard libraries included by default
-   Object-Oriented
-   Excellent support for string and lists operations
-   Many web frameworks
-   Many system utility tools and years of traction as server-side scripting language (if you need to do more advanced server-side tasks in the future)
-   Strong community

-   [Official Python Documentation](http://python.org/doc/)
-   [Python.org's Beginner Guide](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)

## Support

Python also has a fairly vibrant community:

-   [IRC Channel](http://www.python.org/community/irc/)
-   [Mailing Lists](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo)

## Tutorials

-   [Official Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/)
-   [Google's Python Class](https://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/)
-   [HOWTO Use Python in the Web](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/webservers.html)

## Frameworks

Some of the more widely used Python web frameworks are:

-   [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - full stack framework, colloquially referred to as Python's counterpart to Ruby's Rails web framework.
-   [Pylons/Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/)
-   [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
-   [more](http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks)

[WSGI](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/) is the standard API for Python to talk to web servers and most (but not all) web frameworks support it. Understanding a high level overview of the WSGI interface may aid you in understanding the control flow of your web requests when using Python as the backend.
