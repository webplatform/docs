# null

## Summary

null is used to indicate that a variable does not have a value.

## Syntax

    null

## Examples

This example shows the difference between **null** and [undefined](/javascript/undefined).

``` {.js}
var foo; // undefined, there is no value assigned
var bar = null; // null, states that there is no value
```

## Notes

**null** is the only value of the Null type

## null vs. undefined

**null** can be assigned to a variable to represent no value.

[undefined](/javascript/undefined) means a value is declared but not initialized, it doesn't have a value assigned to it.

Other than that, **null** is an object, while **undefined** is a type.
