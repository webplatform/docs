===Remarks===
Areas can be added to or removed from the collection. If duplicate identifiers are found, a collection of those items is returned. Collections of duplicates must be referenced subsequently by ordinal position.
Use of the Area operator is not supported for adding areas to the collection.  Instead, use the [[dom/methods/createElement|'''createElement''']] and [[dom/methods/add|'''add''']] methods.  Alternatively, use the [[dom/methods/insertAdjacentHTML|'''insertAdjacentHTML''']] method.
