Windows that are located in the Internet Zone are subject to Window\_Restrictions and will be forced to stay on screen. This applies to **moveTo**, [**moveBy**](/dom/Window/moveBy), [**resizeTo**](/dom/Window/resizeTo), and [**resizeBy**](/dom/Window/resizeBy) methods. **Note:**  When operating in high-dpi mode, pixel values are scaled up accordingly. See Adjusting Scale for Higher DPI Screens for additional information. Windows Internet Explorer 7. This method is only effective when a single tab is open or when tabbed browsing is disabled. If multiple tabs are open, this method is blocked. For information regarding tab interaction from a script, see Tabbed Browsing for Developers. Internet Explorer 7.
