|Notes====Remarks===
The completion of a CSS transition generates a corresponding Document Object Model (DOM) event. An event is fired for each property that undergoes a transition. This allows a content developer to perform actions that synchronize with the completion of a transition. 

Each event provides the name of the property the transition is associated with as well as the duration of the transition.
