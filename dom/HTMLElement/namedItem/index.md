## Notes

### Remarks

Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8 and later. In IE8 Standards mode, the **namedItem** method does not return collections if more than one named item is found; instead, it returns the first case-insensitive matched Defining Document Compatibility. The **namedItem** method was introduced in Microsoft Internet ExplorerÂ 6. The **namedItem** method does not return collections if more than one named item is found; instead, it returns the first case-insensitive matched **element**. This method first searches for an object with a matching [**id**](/html/attributes/id) attribute. If a match is not found, the method searches for an object with a matching [**name**](/html/attributes/name) attribute, but only on those elements that are allowed a name attribute.
