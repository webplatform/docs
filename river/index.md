## river

A typographical idiosyncrasy in which (typically vertical) visible gaps of whitespace appear to run through a paragraph of text due to a coincidental alignment of spaces. Rivers are most noticeable with wide inter-word spaces in monospaced fonts, but are less noticeable with proportional fonts.
