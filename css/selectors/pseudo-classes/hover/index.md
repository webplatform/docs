## Summary

The :hover pseudo-class applies while the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it

 The :hover pseudo-class applies while the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. Typically, a browser applies this pseudo-class when the mouse pointer hovers over a box generated by the element.

Note that not all pointing devices let the user designating without activating an element (e.g. pen or touch-interactions)

## Examples

The following example sets the hover style of an anchor. When the user hovers the mouse pointer over a link, the text appears in bold red, over a beige background.

``` css
a:hover { color:red; background-color:beige; font-weight:bolder; }
```

## Usage

     The :hover pseudo-class is often used with :active, :link, and :visited; which are the pseudo-classes that affect the other states of a link.

Indiscriminate use of the **:hover** pseudo-class can negatively impact page performance.

## Notes

The order of pseudo-classes is important. For example, the style rule for **:hover** must occur after any [**:link**](/css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:link) rule or any [**:visited**](/css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:visited) rule to prevent the pseudo-classes from hiding each other.
