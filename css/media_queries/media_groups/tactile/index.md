## Summary

The 'tactile media group is used to identify CSS properties and features that apply to a media type that is experienced by the user through touch.

Practical applications of CSS tactile media are currently restricted to Braille-based media ([braille](/w/index.php?title=css/media_queries/media_types/braille&action=edit&redlink=1) for dynamic terminals and [embossed](/w/index.php?title=css/media_queries/media_types/embossed&action=edit&redlink=1) for printed braille documents). However, the concept could be expanded to include other touch-based media, such as 3D printed objects.
