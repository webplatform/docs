## Syntax

-   `text-line-through: <style> <color> <mode>`

## Values

\<style\> \<color\> \<mode\>
:   Values supported by the [text-line-through-style](/css/properties/text-line-through-style), [text-line-through-color](/css/properties/text-line-through-color), and [text-line-through-mode](/css/properties/text-line-through-mode) properties.

## Usage

     This property is obsolete and has been replaced by the  text-decoration property.

Originally defined in an earlier draft of the [CSS3 Text Module specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/), the functionality controlled by this property is now defined in the [CSS Text Decoration Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-3) module. Sites (and apps) relying on the earlier behavior should be updated accordingly.
