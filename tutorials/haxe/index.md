## Summary

An overview of and an introduction to Haxe.

## Introduction

Haxe is a *multi-platform*, open-source programming language, which is able to compile to many programming languages - most notably, JavaScript. It is very similar syntactically to Java and Actionscript 3, and so will feel very similar to a lot of programmers. It is object-oriented with the usual such as classes and interfaces, however it features another interesting concept: a type definition (or typedef). This will either act as a referral to another class, or a 'template' for Dynamic objects.

## Downloading the Haxe compiler and a compatible IDE

***(Note: you can skip this step if you choose to use [the online editor](http://try.haxe.org))*** The [Haxe compiler](http://haxe.org/download) is easily installed, and there are [many IDEs](http://haxe.org/com/ide) with plugins available. Download the plugin for your favourite IDE and create a new Haxe project with the default values.
