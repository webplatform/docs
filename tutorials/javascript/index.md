JavaScript tutorials index page.

API Name
:   Summary

[Iterators and generators](/concepts/javascript/iterators)
:   Processing each of the items in a collection is a very common operation. JavaScript provides a number of ways of iterating over a collection, from simple `for` and `for each` loops to `map()`, `filter()]]` and array comprehensions. Iterators and Generators, introduced in JavaScript 1.7, bring the concept of iteration directly into the core language and provide a mechanism for customizing the behavior of `for...in` and `for each` loops.

[core objects](/concepts/programming/javascript/core_objects)
:   This chapter describes the predefined objects in core JavaScript: `Array`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Function`, `Math`, `Number`, `RegExp`, and `String`.

[expressions](/concepts/programming/javascript/expressions)
:   This chapter describes JavaScript expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, and special operators.

[JavaScript Functions](/concepts/programming/javascript/functions)
:   Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

[Inheritance revisited](/concepts/programming/javascript/inheritance)
:   Inheritance has always been available in JavaScript, but the examples on this page use some methods introduced in ECMAScript 5.

[About LiveConnect](/concepts/programming/javascript/liveconnect)
:   This chapter describes using LiveConnect technology to let Java and JavaScript code communicate with each other. The chapter assumes you are familiar with Java programming.

[objects](/concepts/programming/javascript/objects)
:   JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is association between a name and a value. A value of property can be a function, which is then known as the object's method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

    This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.

Since these features are relatively new, support across browsers can vary. You should keep this in mind as you develop your web app to make it the best possible user experience across all browsers. In this document we will discuss the new features, how to detect and handle non-supporting browsers, and mobile considerations.

[Objects in JavaScript](/tutorials/objects_in_javascript)
:   This article takes the concept of functions further, looking at how you can encapsulate functions and variables into reusable packages of functionality called objects.

[Offline apps](/tutorials/offline)
:   Mobile users expect to have the ability to open an app and interact with it, no matter if they have a connection.

    AppCache provides a solution that allows you to cache your entire app on a user's device. This allows your app to continue working even when the user is offline. When the user is connected, AppCache will also make the app load faster by minimizing the number of requests made to your server.

    In addition to the benefits offered by AppCache, modern browsers allow storing of a user's app specific data, for example their high scores in a game, via localStorage. Using these two features enables your app to work in an offline state.

    Gmail, for example, uses both of these features so that you can continue to read your emails, even on a plane.

    Note that this guide focuses on mobile, but the same practices can be applied to desktop, as well.
