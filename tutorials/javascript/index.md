## Summary

JavaScript tutorials index page.

API Name
:   Summary
[Iterators and generators](/concepts/javascript/iterators)
:   Processing each of the items in a collection is a very common operation. JavaScript provides a number of ways of iterating over a collection, from simple `for` and `for each` loops to `map()`, `filter()]]` and array comprehensions. Iterators and Generators, introduced in JavaScript 1.7, bring the concept of iteration directly into the core language and provide a mechanism for customizing the behavior of `for...in` and `for each` loops.
[core objects](/concepts/programming/javascript/core_objects)
:   This chapter describes the predefined objects in core JavaScript: `Array`, `Boolean`, `Date`, `Function`, `Math`, `Number`, `RegExp`, and `String`.
[expressions](/concepts/programming/javascript/expressions)
:   This chapter describes JavaScript expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, and special operators.
[JavaScript Functions](/concepts/programming/javascript/functions)
:   Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
[Inheritance revisited](/concepts/programming/javascript/inheritance)
:   Inheritance has always been available in JavaScript, but the examples on this page use some methods introduced in ECMAScript 5.
[About LiveConnect](/concepts/programming/javascript/liveconnect)
:   This chapter describes using LiveConnect technology to let Java and JavaScript code communicate with each other. The chapter assumes you are familiar with Java programming.
[objects](/concepts/programming/javascript/objects)
:   JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is association between a name and a value. A value of property can be a function, which is then known as the object's method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

    This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.
