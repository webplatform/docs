## proportional font

A font whose characters occupy different amounts of horizontal space, such that typically-narrow letters like "i" and typically-wide letters like "w" are not the same width. Also called variable-pitch font. This entire definition is in a proportional font. Contrast with [monospaced font](/monospaced_font).
