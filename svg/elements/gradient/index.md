The **SVGGradientElement** object has these events:

-   [**onload**](/svg/events/load): Occurs when the browser has fully parsed the element and all of its descendants.

The **SVGGradientElement** object has these properties:

-   [**className**](/svg/properties/className): Gets the names of the classes that are assigned to this object.
-   [**externalResourcesRequired**](/svg/properties/externalResourcesRequired): Gets a value that indicates whether referenced resources that are not in the current document are required to correctly render a given element.
-   [**focusable**](/svg/properties/focusable): Determines if an element can acquire keyboard focus (that is, receive keyboard events) and be a target for field-to-field navigation actions (such as when a user presses the Tab key).
-   [**gradientTransform**](/svg/properties/gradientTransform): Gets a value that contains the definition of an optional, additional transformation from the gradient coordinate system onto the target coordinate system.
-   [**gradientUnits**](/svg/properties/gradientUnits): Gets a value that indicates the type of coordinate system that is used because of a transformation.
-   [**href**](/svg/properties/href): Gets an **xlink:href** attribute of an element.
