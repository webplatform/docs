## SVG browser support

Eventually it would be nice to have an up-to-date overview of SVG in the latest browsers here. For now, have a look at [wikipedia's page on the topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics#Support_for_SVG_in_web_browsers).

### Hardware acceleration

Support for <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration> SVG can greatly boost performance.

Today's popular desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera and Safari) all support it to various degrees.

*TODO: List of mobile browsers with their levels of support.*
