## Summary

Accessibility is making the Web work for people with a diverse range of abilities. Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services. Accessibility is vital to enable people with disabilities to participate equally on the Web. It is a legal requirement in some cases, and a best practice in all cases.

[Accessibility basics](/Accessibility_basics)
:   This page refers to the inclusive practice of making websites usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.

[Web accessibility basics](/concepts/accessibility)
:   Accessibility is making the Web work for people with a diverse range of abilities. Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services. Accessibility is vital to enable people with disabilities to participate equally on the Web. It is a legal requirement in some cases, and a best practice in all cases.

[Assistive Technology (AT) Tools](/concepts/accessibility/at_tools)
:   Assistive technology tools help people with physical limitations access web content. To work effectively, these tools require that the information in the web site is contained in the expected format: words are given as text characters (not images), different types of content (e.g. headings, emphasized text) are distinguished with the correct markup tags (not simply by stylistic effects), and interactive components aren't dependent on particular methods of user input (such as mouse clicks).

[cue](/css/properties/cue)
:   The `cue` property specifies sound files (known as an "auditory icon") to be played by speech media agents before and after presenting an element's content; if only one file is specified, it is played both before and after. The volume at which the file(s) should be played, relative to the volume of the main element, may also be specified. The icon files may also be set separately with the [`cue-before`](/css/properties/cue-before) and [`cue-after`](/css/properties/cue-after) properties.

[cue-before](/css/properties/cue-before)
:   The `cue-before` property specifies a sound file (known as an "auditory icon") to be played by speech media agents before presenting an element's content; the volume at which the file should be played may also be specified. The shorthand property [`cue`](/css/properties/cue) sets cue sounds for both before and after the element is presented.

[pause](/css/properties/pause)
:   The `pause` property determines how long a speech media agent should pause before and after presenting an element. It is a shorthand for the [`pause-before`](/css/properties/pause-before) and [`pause-after`](/css/properties/pause-before) properties.

[pause-after](/css/properties/pause-after)
:   The `pause-after` property determines how long a speech media agent should pause after presenting an element. It may be replaced by the shorthand property [`pause`](/css/properties/pause), which sets pause time before and after.

[pause-before](/css/properties/pause-before)
:   The `pause-before` property determines how long a speech media agent should pause before presenting an element. It may be replaced by the shorthand property [`pause`](/css/properties/pause), which sets pause time before and after.

[rest](/css/properties/rest)
:   The `rest` property determines how long a speech media agent should pause in between presenting an element's main content and presenting the before and after cue sounds. It is a shorthand for the [`rest-before`](/css/properties/rest-before) and [`rest-after`](/css/properties/rest-after) properties.

[rest-after](/css/properties/rest-after)
:   The `rest-after` property determines how long a speech media agent should pause after presenting an element's main content, before presenting that element's [exit cue sound](/css/properties/cue-after). It may be replaced by the shorthand property [`rest`](/css/properties/rest), which sets rest time before and after.

[rest-before](/css/properties/rest-before)
:   The `rest-before` property determines how long a speech media agent should pause after presenting an [intro cue sound](/css/properties/cue-before) for an element, before presenting that element's main content. It may be replaced by the shorthand property [`rest`](/css/properties/rest), which sets rest time before and after.

[speak](/css/properties/speak)
:   The `speak` property determines whether or not a speech synthesizer will read aloud the contents of an element.

[speak-as](/css/properties/speak-as)
:   The `speak-as` property determines how the speech synthesizer interprets the content: words as whole words or as a sequence of letters, numbers as a numerical value or a sequence of digits, punctuation as pauses in speech or named punctuation characters.

[voice-balance](/css/properties/voice-balance)
:   The `voice-balance` property sets the apparent position (in stereo sound) of the synthesized voice for spoken media.

[voice-duration](/css/properties/voice-duration)
:   The `voice-duration` property allows the author to explicitly set the amount of time it should take a speech synthesizer to read an element's content, for example to allow the speech to be synchronized with other media. With a value of `auto` (the default) the length of time it takes to read the content is determined by the content itself and the [`voice-rate`](/css/properties/voice-rate) property.

[voice-family](/css/properties/voice-family)
:   The `voice-family` property sets the speaker's voice used by a speech media agent to read an element. The speaker may be specified as a named character (to match a voice option in the speech reading software) or as a generic description of the age and gender of the voice. Similar to the [`font-family`](/css/properties/font-family) property for visual media, a comma-separated list of fallback options may be given in case the speech reader does not recognize the character name or cannot synthesize the requested combination of generic properties.

[voice-pitch](/css/properties/voice-pitch)
:   The `voice-pitch` property sets pitch or tone (high or low) for the synthesized speech when reading an element; the pitch may be specified absolutely or relative to the normal pitch for the [`voice-family`](/css/properties/voice-family) used to read the text.

[voice-range](/css/properties/voice-range)
:   The `voice-range` property determines how much variation in pitch or tone will be created by the speech synthesize when reading an element. Emphasized text, grammatical structures and punctuation may all be rendered as changes in pitch, this property determines how strong or obvious those changes are; large ranges are associated with enthusiastic or emotional speech, while small ranges are associated with flat or mechanical speech.

[voice-rate](/css/properties/voice-rate)
:   The `voice-rate` property sets the speed at which the voice synthesized by a speech media agent will read content.

[voice-stress](/css/properties/voice-stress)
:   The `voice-stress` property sets the level of vocal emphasis to be used for synthesized speech reading the element.

[voice-volume](/css/properties/voice-volume)
:   The `voice-volume` property sets the volume for spoken content in speech media. It replaces the deprecated `volume` property.

[alt](/html/attributes/alt)
:   The **alt** attribute is used as a textual representation for graphics and buttons in browsers that don't or can't render images, or when the resource is not found.
